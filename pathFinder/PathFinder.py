        Define the graph using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list. An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the value at row i and column j represents the weight of the edge from node i to node j. If there is no edge between i and j, the value can be set to infinity or a large number. An adjacency list is a list of lists where the ith element contains a list of tuples representing the edges from node i to other nodes and their weights.

        Define a function that takes the graph, start node, end node, and a list of nodes to pass through as input.

        Modify the graph to exclude non-pass-through nodes. Set the weights of all edges to and from these nodes to infinity.

        Initialize a distance matrix and a path matrix. The distance matrix is a 2D array where the value at row i and column j represents the shortest distance from node i to node j. Initially, the matrix should be a copy of the original graph, but the distances to non-pass-through nodes should be set to infinity. The path matrix is a 2D array where the value at row i and column j represents the next node in the shortest path from node i to node j.

        Implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes. This algorithm works by considering all intermediate nodes k and computing the shortest path from i to j through k.

        Trace the shortest path from the start node to the end node using the path matrix. To do this, start at the start node and repeatedly follow the path to the next node until the end node is reached.

        Return the shortest path and the total distance of the path.
